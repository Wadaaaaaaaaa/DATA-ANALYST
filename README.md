# Introduction :
The project aims to deliver strategic insights to Bolt , focusing on areas vital for operational
efficiency and customer satisfaction. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing data
collection, cleaning, visualization, and association techniques, the project aspires to unveil
actionable intelligence that will empower Bolt in making informed decisions for the benefit of
both the company and its clientele.

# Key objectives :
1. Optimizing Peak Hour Management:
• Analyze Bolt dataset to identify peak hours.
• Develop strategies for efficient resource allocation during peak times.
2. Refining Resource Planning:
• Utilize data analysis techniques to inform resource planning.
• Ensure optimal utilization of resources based on historical data
3. Elevating Customer Experience:
• Extract insights from Bolt dataset regarding user preferences.
• Implement predictive models to enhance the overall customer experience.

# Key steps in the project include:
1. Data Collection: Gather Bolt travel-related data, including the number of rides per day,the number of rides per month, etc.

2. Data Cleaning:Apply cleaning techniquesto eliminate inconsistencies, missing values,
and anomalies in the data, ensuring data quality.

3. Data Analysis: Utilize R packages to conduct in-depth data analysis, focusing on
criteria such as the daily number of rides, monthly ride count, etc.

4. Data Visualization: Create visualizations using ggplot2 to graphically represent trends and patterns identified during data analysis.

5. Information Extraction: Utilize user data to extract meaningful insights, with a focus
on accurately predicting clients likely to take Bolt trips and rides.

6. Average Passenger Determination: Identify the daily average number of Bolt
passengers using the analysis results.
7. Peak Hour Identification: Determine peak hours when there are more available clients
based on data analysis.

8. Peak Day Analysis: Identify the day of the month with the highest number of rides.

9. Association and Dimensioning: Apply association techniques to identify relationships
between different factors and perform data dimensioning for better understanding.

10. Frequent Item Sets: Analyze frequent item sets to identify patterns in Bolt customer
behavior.

11. Predictions: Implement prediction models based on insights extracted from data to
anticipate potential Bolt trip clients.

12. Advanced Peak Hour Analysis:
Can you identify specific factors contributing to peak hours, such as external events,
holidays, or weather conditions?
13. Resource Allocation Optimization:
How can you dynamically adjust resource allocation strategies based on real-time data
to respond to unforeseen demand fluctuations?

14. Customer Segmentation:
Can you create nuanced customer segments based on diverse criteria within the Bolt
dataset, and how might this segmentation inform tailored strategies?

15. Predictive Model Evaluation:
What methods will you use to rigorously evaluate the performance of your predictive
models, and how can you address potential biases or limitations in the data?

16. Temporal Patterns Beyond Daily Peaks:
Are there significant temporal patterns beyond daily peaks, such as weekly or monthly
trends, and how might these impact Bolt 's long-term planning?

17. Association Analysis Challenges:
What challenges did you encounter in the association analysis, and how did you address
issues related to spurious correlations or irrelevant associations?
18. Handling Data Privacy and Security:
How did you ensure compliance with data privacy regulations while working with userspecific data, and what security measures were implemented to safeguard sensitive
information?

19. Scalability of Predictive Models:
Considering the dynamic nature of Bolt 's user base, how scalable are the predictive
models, and what measures are in place to accommodate future growth?

20. Temporal Dynamics in User Preferences:
How do user preferences evolve over time, and can you identify temporal dynamics that
might influence Bolt 's service adaptation strategies?

21. Integration with External Data Sources:
Have you explored integrating external data sources beyond the Bolt dataset to enhance
the richness of your analysis, and how might thisimpact the robustness of your findings?


# Deliverables:
1. PowerPoint Presentation: (25 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)
    • Summarize project goals, methodology, and key findings.
    • Showcase visualizations and insights derived from the Bolt dataset.

2. R Source Code:
    • Provide well-documented R code used for data analysis and modeling.
      
# Submission Deadline: last class session
